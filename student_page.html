            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Objective:</b> The objective of the game is to test 
                    the players' knowledge of programming concepts and
                    languages.</p></li>

                <li><p><b>Format:</b> The game can be played individually or 
                    in teams. Each player/team will be asked a series of
                    questions related to programming.</p></li>
            
                <li><p><b>Questions:</b> Questions can be multiple-choice, true/false, fill in
                    the blanks, or open-ended. They should cover a wide
                    range of programming topics, such as syntax, data
                    structures, algorithms, and programming languages.</p></li>
            
                <li><p><b>Difficulty Levels:</b> Questions can be categorized into different
                    difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard. This allows
                    players to choose their preferred level of challenge.</p></li>
        
                <li><p><b>Time Limit:</b> Each player/team should be given a specific time
                    limit to answer each question. This keeps the game engaging
                    and adds a sense of urgency.</p></li>
        
                <li><p><b>Scoring:</b> Players/teams earn points for each correct answer.
                    The points can be awarded based on the difficulty level of the question.
                    For example, harder questions can carry more points.</p></li>


                <li><p><b>Bonus Rounds:</b>You can include bonus rounds where players
                /teams have the opportunity to earn additional points. These rounds
                    can include coding challenges or puzzles that require 
                    problem-solving skills.</p></li>
